Class: CSC-207


## Resources

Tutors: helped with multiple small problems, mainly the fail fast test.


## Assignment description

Code for mini-project-8 on implementing a circular list interface with doubly
linked lists with a dummy node, that also uses a Fail Fast policy.

## Github Link
https://github.com/NyTenner/Project-8.git

## Benefits
Having a dummy node can help a lot with some methods such as add, because NullPointerException are no longer a problem. It can also simplify the uses of many other methods.

## Recognition

The classes Node2 and Simple list were taken with permission from https://github.com/Grinnell-CSC207/lab-linked-lists.git and the other classes used some of the other classes from it as a template.
